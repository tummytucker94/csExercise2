# csExercise2
The purpose of this exercise is to familiarize myself with using C# and Algorithm Design.  

I used the following algorithm to design this simple program:  

Goal: Write a program in C# that prints the sum of two integers.

Start

1) Get an integer value for "num1";
2) Get an integer value for "num2";
3) Set the integer value of "sum" to the arithmetic expression "num1 + num2".
4) Print the value of "sum".
